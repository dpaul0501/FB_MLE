Walmart is a renowned retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets. Here, Walmart has provided a data combining of 45 stores including store information and monthly sales. The data is provided on weekly basis. Walmart tries to find the impact of holidays on the sales of store. For which it has included four holidaysâ€™ weeks into the dataset which are Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super bowl, Labor Day. Here we are owing to Analyze the dataset given. Before doing that, let me point out the objective of this analysis.

## Business Objective

Our Main Objective is to understand weekly sales data of different stores and build a predictive model for sale forecasting. We want you to go deep into the data and analyze it to generate insights for sale forecasting.

1. Each store belongs to certain type, size. Also a store can have multiple department. We also want to understand the affect of different macroeconomic/external factors like fuel price, temperature. You need to also investigate how inclusion of holidays in a week soars/diminishes the sales in store. This would involve doing an exploratory data analysis.

2. We also want to evaluate data quality and apply appropriate transformation to the data for modeling

3. Finally we want to select important feature by understanding relation between features and weekly sales
